                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Chop up the Onion, Garlic, Carrot and Celery into small
                        pieces. Place in a large pot coated in a heavy amount of
                        olive oil and let simmer on low heat for 15-20 minutes.
                        Add salt and pepper to taste.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once a light brown frond starts to form at the bottom of
                        the pot, add the meat. Mix well with the veg and let
                        simmer for an additional 15-20 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once the frond starts turning a darker brown and the
                        liquid of all the veg and meat is gone, add the tomato
                        paste. Mix well and repeat the process until there is a
                        good amount of frond at the bottom of the pot.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add a decent amount of wine (at least half a bottle) to
                        deglaze the frond.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add enough water so that everything is submerged. Add
                        the bay leaves and thyme, mix well and let cook for 3-5
                        hours. Make sure to stir every 15-20 minutes. Add salt
                        and pepper as needed. If liquid is running low, add more
                        water.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Serve with pasta of your choice and add chopped up
                        parsley.
                    </li>
                </ol>
