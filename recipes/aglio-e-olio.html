        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a pot, boil water and cook spaghetti a couple minutes less
                than stated on package. Season generously with salt.
            </li>
            <li>Thinly slice the garlic, as thin as you can possibly go.</li>
            <li>
                In a sauce pan, heat up a generous amount of olive oil on medium
                and add the garlic.
            </li>
            <li>After a couple of minutes, add peperoncino to taste.</li>
            <li>
                After garlic has been cooking for 4 minutes, take a ladel and
                add a couple of scoops of pasta water into the sauce pan. Stir
                to mix thoroughly.
            </li>
            <li>
                When pasta is finished cooking, add directly to sauce pan and
                finish cooking in there for a couple of minutes. Stir to make
                sure pasta is sufficiently coated with sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                When pasta is al dente, remove and sprinkle with parsley and eat
                away!
            </li>
        </ol>
